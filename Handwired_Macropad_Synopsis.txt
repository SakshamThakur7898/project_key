INTRODUCTION:  
In the modern computing environment, efficiency and ease of access to frequently used commands are crucial. A macropad is a compact and customizable keypad that provides additional input options to enhance workflow. This project focuses on designing and building a **handwired 3x3 macropad** utilizing the **ATmega32U4 microcontroller**, which natively supports USB HID (Human Interface Device) functionality. The macropad will allow users to program custom keybindings for various applications, such as gaming, video editing, and software development. Additionally, future integration of **VIA compatibility** will allow for real-time key remapping without requiring firmware reflashing, making the device more user-friendly.
